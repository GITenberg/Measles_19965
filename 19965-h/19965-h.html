<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">W. C. Rucker</span></span>, Assistant Surgeon General, United States Public Health Service.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Over 11,000 American children died of measles in the year 1910.
This did not include a large number who died of broncho-pneumonia,
a great number of cases of which, in children, are caused by measles.
Sixty-eight and two-tenths per cent of all deaths from broncho-pneumonia
occur in children under 5 years of age, a time of life when
measles is most apt to occur. But the story of the ravages of this
disease is not complete without the mention of the large number of
cases of tuberculosis which follow an attack of it. Less frequently
inflammation of the ear or the eye may be left behind as a mark of a
visitation of this common disease. From a public health standpoint,
then, measles is a disease of prime importance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Long association with a disease breeds a contempt for it, and
measles, in common with the other diseases of childhood, has come
to be looked upon as an unavoidable accompaniment of youth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each autumn when school opens there is an increase in the number
of cases of measles, and as the season progresses they gradually
increase, and winter frequently sees the disease spreading in epidemic
form. Hirsch has collected data of 309 epidemics of measles, and
has classified them according to season; summer had 43, autumn had
76, winter had 96, and spring had 94 epidemics.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Measles is a disease of close association; hence its increase during
the colder months.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Frequently a child will go to a party and engage in innocent games
in which children are brought in close contact with one another.
Perhaps among the guests there is one with reddened, watery, eyes,
which are sensitive to light. The eyelids are perhaps a little puffy,
and the guest has a hard, high-pitched cough. The other children
pay no attention to this, and the games go on uninterruptedly. In
this way a single child in the beginning stages of measles may easily
affect 15 or 20 others. This is frequently the case when kissing games
are played.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About 10 days later the children who have exposed themselves to
the disease begin to sicken. They, too, have red, watery, sensitive
eyes and puffy eyelids. In fact, in rather severe cases the whole face
has a rather swollen, puffed appearance. The throat feels parched
and a dry, irritating cough increases the discomfort. The child is apt
to come home from school feeling drowsy and irritable, not infrequently
complains of chilly sensations, and may even have a chill.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
At night the irritation increases, the child is feverish, the whites of
the eyeballs show little red lines upon them, and the little sufferer
has the appearance of being just ready to cry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the anxious mother takes the child to the window in the morning,
raises the curtain, and examines the little one's throat she will
see that the hard palate and back of the throat are a dull, angry red.
Perhaps there are a few little red spots on the hard palate, and if
the mother will look closely at the lining membrane of the cheek she
will see some small white-tipped, reddish spots. These are called
"Koplik's" spots, and are one of the signs of measles.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The child is kept from school that day, and that night his fever is
higher than it was the night before. He rolls and tosses about the
bed and wakes up his mother a good many times to ask for a drink
of water. This sort of thing continues for 3 or 4 days; then, one morning
when the child is having its bath the mother sees some little
dusky red spots along the hair line. They look a good deal like flea
bites. Within 24 hours this rash is spread over the body and the
child looks very much bespeckled and swollen. In from 5 to 7 days
the rash begins to fade, and within 3 or 4 days thereafter is entirely
gone away, leaving behind a faint mottling of the skin. This is followed
by a peeling off of the outer layer of the skin in little bran-like
pieces. This process is called desquamation, and lasts about a week
or 10 days.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the fever has gone away, and as soon as the child
has finished scaling he is permitted to go out and play with the other
children, and before long is back at school. The foregoing is a description
of a mild case.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If measles assume a malignant type, as it sometimes does among
the nonrobust, it may be ushered in by convulsions, very high fever,
and an excessive development of all the ordinary symptoms, or the
rash when it appears, instead of being a good healthy-looking red,
may be a bluish-black discoloration which looks like a recent bruise.
Broncho-pneumonia, the most common and the most fatal of all the
complications of measles, is very apt to occur. The cough is very
painful, and death quickly relieves the sufferer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two forms of the disease which have just been cited are in no
way exaggerated and unfortunately they are of far too common occurrence.
The first child received the infection directly in the harmless
games at the party by coming in intimate contact with a child who
was just coming down with measles at a time when, according to the
researches of Anderson and Goldberger in the Hygienic Laboratory of
the United States Public Health Service, the infecting virus is most
active. Their work seems to show that the infection does not persist
after the fever has gone away.</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While all of the severe cases may not be as grave as the one which
was cited above, it must be admitted, nevertheless, that broncho-pneumonia
is the great menace of measles. Fifty-odd years ago
Gregory wrote "I am sure I speak much within bounds when I say
that nine-tenths of the deaths by measles occur in consequence of
pneumonia." Less frequently there are other complications, and the
eyes, ears, the central nervous system, heart, and the skin may any
one of them suffer. Sometimes there is gangrene at the corners of the
mouth and this may result in death or horrible deformity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Measles, then, is a serious disease, sparing practically no exposed
person who has not had it. In 1846 it attacked the Faroe Islands,
and the record of that visitation is both remarkable and instructive.
The island had been free from the disease for 65 years, when a Danish
cabinetmaker returned from Copenhagen to Thorshavn with the
disease. He infected two friends, and the epidemic increased by
leaps and bounds, until within a very short time over 6,000 persons
out of a population of 7,782 were attacked. Almost every house on
the island became a hospital, and the only persons who passed through
the visitation unscathed were old inhabitants who had had the
disease as children 65 years before. Not a single old person who was
not protected by a previous attack and who was exposed to the
infection failed to contract the disease.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is one of the oldest ailments with which man has been afflicted.
In fact the word "measles" traces its genealogy back through the
German "masern" to the Sanskrit "masura," a word meaning "spots."
The writings of the ancient Arabian physicians are replete with
mention of this disease. The Italians, who evidently regarded it no
more seriously than we do, called it "morbillo," which means "little
sickness."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Time and again measles has been widely diffused on Asiatic and European
soil, and shortly after the colonization of America it appeared in
our colonies. Many are the quaint records of its visitations, not the
least interesting of which is a letter which appeared in the Boston
Evening Post, November 12, 1739, entitled "A letter about good management
under the distemper of measles at this time spreading in
the country, here published for the benefit of the poor and such as
may want help of able physicians." It is signed "Your hearty friend
and servant," and the authorship is attributed to Cotton Mather. It
is stated that this letter is a reprint of one which Dr. Mather wrote
prior to his death in 1728.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At present the disease is distributed over the entire habitable globe,
from Iceland on the north to Tierra del Fuego on the south. It occurs
most often and more severely in the colder months, probably because
at such times people are more closely crowded together under more<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
insanitary conditions. When introduced among a people who have
never suffered from it before, its ravages are frightful, as in the case
of the inhabitants of certain of the Fiji Islands, who, upon being
exposed to the infection, fell ill and died by thousands, so that it
is estimated that 20,000 deaths occurred in four months. The epidemic
ceased only when almost every person on the island had been
infected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the year 1910 the death rates from this disease in the States
of Rhode Island and North Carolina were 32.6 and 27.1 per 100,000
inhabitants.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the same year the death rate per 100,000 from measles in Pittsburgh,
Pa., was 33.1; Providence, R. I., 31.9; Kansas City, Mo.,
28.4; Lowell, Mass., 28.1; Albany, N. Y., 23.9; Columbus, Ohio,
23.6; Buffalo, N. Y., 22.1; and Richmond, Va., 21.1.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The death rate among those attacked varies from 1/2 to 35 per cent.
If it is estimated that the death rate is 1 per cent, and the number
of deaths from it in the United States during the year 1910 was 11,000,
then it would follow that during that year at least 1,100,000 children
suffered from this disease. When it is considered that perhaps 30
per cent of these children were of school age, and that the disease
occurs most often during the months of school attendance, then it
will be seen that 330,000 children were kept from school from six
weeks to two months on account of measles. Leaving out of consideration
the death and suffering which was produced in this way,
this is a serious economic loss.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Measles is a frequent accompaniment of war, or any other occasion
which brings large numbers of persons together under unhygienic
conditions. In fact, measles is one of the most formidable of camp
diseases. This fact is well demonstrated by morbidity and mortality
statistics of the Civil War. At that time the mortality rate was very
high in the general field hospital at Chattanooga, being 22.4 per cent,
and in the general field hospital at Nashville it was 19.6 per cent. In
1865 there were 38,000 cases with 1,900 deaths from measles in the
Confederate army. It is reported that during the Brazilio-Paraguayan
War an epidemic of measles swept off nearly a fifth of the
Paraguayan army in three months.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is thus seen that measles is many times a very severe disease,
one which can not be dealt with lightly, one to which we should not
expose our children. A child with measles should be put to bed
and kept there as long as it has any fever or cough. The room should
be airy, but it should be darkened, because children with measles are
very sensitive to light. The bedclothes should be light, because the
child is apt to get too warm, kick off the covers, and suffer from the
cold. A chilling in this way may predispose to pneumonia. Food
should be light and should consist chiefly of nutritious broths, pasteurized<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
milk, soft-boiled eggs, and the like. Ice lemonade will
bring comfort to the inflamed throat. The child's eyes should be
kept clean, and should the fever get high the comfort of the little
sufferer may be increased by sponging with tepid water and alcohol.
Sometimes it is necessary to put an ice bag to the head, but, if the
child is sick enough to require this, skilled assistance should be
summoned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the fever and cough have gone the child may be allowed
to be up and about the room, but for a time should not indulge
in violent exercise, because there is often some weakening of the
heart muscle by the disease. The aim is to allow the heart muscle
to regain its normal condition before putting too much strain upon
it. The diet should be increased when the fever has gone away,
and should include good, plain, strong foods. If there is a tendency
to regain weight and strength slowly, the child may be given
an increased amount of pasteurized cream or good butter. If the
child prefers cod-liver oil, this may be substituted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The important point about the prevention of the disease is the fact
that, judging from the experiments of Anderson and Goldberger
above referred to, measles is rarely transmissible after the fever has
gone down. Experimenting with monkeys, they found that they
were unable to transmit measles from monkey to monkey after the
stage of fever had ceased. It used to be thought that the germs of
measles were in the scales of skin which were shed at the close of the
disease.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is thought by some that there may be chronic carriers of measles,
but this is not at all proven. It is also believed that a discharging
ear following measles may be the means of continuing the transmission
of the disease. This is not proven. There are on record a
large number of instances which seem to point to the fact that under
certain conditions a third person may carry the infection from the
sick to the well. Transmission of measles to human beings by the
lower animals is still unproven.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not known what the cause of measles is. A great many
scientists have described germs which they believe to be the causal
agents, but up to date these have not been positively proven as the
cause of measles. We do, however, know that the infection of measles
is found in the secretions from the nose and throat during the first
stages of the disease; therefore persons suffering with measles should
not be allowed to come in contact with well persons until the period
of fever has well passed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the disease is known to be spread by the sputum, the prime
measure in the prevention of this disease is to prevent the sputum
from the sick being taken into the system of well persons. Children
with measles should be provided with a quantity of soft paper napkins,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and as soon as the napkins become soiled they should be burned.
Children should be taught that they must always hold a handkerchief
in front of the mouth while coughing. This is a measure which tends
to control the spread of a good many diseases besides measles, because
during coughing and sneezing sputum may be thrown several feet.
Everything which has come in contact with measles patients should
be sterilized before it is allowed to come in contact with other people
or other things which may be handled or used by other people. Bedclothes,
napkins, table linen, towels, and the like may be sterilized by
boiling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When it is known that measles exists in a community, no child having
a bad cough should be allowed to come in contact with other
children during the first three or four days of the cough.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is little less than criminal to permit children known to have
measles to come in contact with well children. In this connection
it may be remarked that while it is generally considered that one
attack of measles confers immunity, there are many cases on record
of second and third attacks. It is true that the second attacks are
usually very mild, but too great reliance should not be placed on this
immunity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Children should be discouraged as far as possible from playing
games which will permit of an interchange of nasal or mouth secretions.
It is the duty of every parent having measles in the home to
see to it that it is reported to the public-health authorities. It is
equally the duty of parents to see to it that their children do not
come in contact with well children during the time when the infection
may be transmitted. Measles kills more people in the United States
every year than smallpox. You can't kill a child any deader with
smallpox than you can with measles. It is the duty of private citizens
and municipalities to take every known measure for the prevention of
the spread of this disease.</p>
